/**
 * An object graph serializer can be used to serialize an object including all of its
 * fields and all referenced objects to a sequence of bytes which can be written to
 * a permanent storage. Later on, the graph of objects can be restored from the 
 * persisted data.
 * <p>
 * TODO Meta data evolution?
 * <p>
 * Limitations:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *     The serialization protocol of Java's {@link Serializable} is not fully supported.
 *     It is recommended that you write a custom serializer for the class if it requires
 *     special handling and registers it using 
 *     {@link IObjectGraphSerializer#registerSerializer(Class, IObjectSerializer)}.
 *     However, most classes from the java.* packages which implement the Serializable 
 *     interface should work with. If you encounter a class from java.* which makes 
 *     problems with this serializer, please report it.       
 *     </li>
